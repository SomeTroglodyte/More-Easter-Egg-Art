# More Easter Egg Art
## A Mod for Unciv

Adds imagery that Unciv will show as "Easter eggs" on certain dates, as simply floating around on the main menu screen from time to time.

## Requirements

Requires [#11483](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/pull/11483) to work. That likely means version 4.11.6 or later.
